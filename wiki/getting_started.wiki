=Getting Started=


==Download Eclipse ==

The first thing that you need in order to create a BPMN extension by using BPMN+X is a copy of Eclipse Modeling Tools. In this tutorial, we will use Eclipse Indigo. Download it by clicking here and unzip it in a folder of your choice.

==Install Dependencies==
Run eclipse, leave the workspace name as is and click Ok.
After that, go to Help -> Install Modeling Components. The window shown in Figure 1 will be displayed. Select the Jet, Operational QVT and OCL Tools Components and click Finish.

When prompted, select all the items shown to be installed. Then click Next twice, accept the terms and click Finish. Click Restart Now once the components are downloaded and installed.

Then, download the UML2Tools [http://bpmnx.googlecode.com/files/mdt-uml2tools-Update-incubation-I201103290512.zip] update site. Open the eclipse window and select Help -> Install New Software.  Click Add and then Archive and select the file you have just downloaded and click OK.

Then select all the items shown to be installed, click Next twice, accept the terms and click Finish. Click Ok if any Warning is displayed. Finally, restart Eclipse.

==Install BPMN+X plugins==
The BPMN+X plugins are available here [http://bpmnx.googlecode.com/files/bpmnx_plugins_v1.zip]. Download and unzip them. Copy the four jar files you have just unzipped to the *path_to_eclipse/eclipse/plugins* folder and restart eclipse.

==Try the sample projects==
Download the Sample Workspace [[http://bpmnx.googlecode.com/files/workspace_v2.zip]] and unzip the file. In the Eclipse ide, click File -> Switch Workspace -> Other and Browse the folder you have just unzipped.
Then unfold the model folder within the org.cidisi.bpmn.extension.sample project. Open workDistribution.umlclass to see the sample BPMN+X model provided.

Finally, run the umlToXSD and Jet Transformations in order to produce machine-readable files representing the provided extension.

*Figure 5. Running the transformations*

The files produced by the umlToXSD transformation are:

    *  workDistribution.xmlschema

    *  workDistribution.xmlschema.qvtotrace



The files produced by the Jet Transformation are

    *  WorkDistribution.xsd
    
    *  dump.xml


The Jet transformation also copies the files defining the BPMN interchange format to the output folder:

    *  BPMN20.xsd
    
    *  BPMNDI.xsd

    *  DC.xsd

    *  DI.xsd

    *  Semantic.xsd
